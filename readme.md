**Training a Rasa Model**

To train a Rasa model, you need to define the NLU training data, domain configuration, stories configuration, and NLU configuration.

**NLU Training Data**

Create a file named `nlu.yml` in the `data` directory with the following content:
```
version: "3.0"

nlu:
- intent: ask_about_kadalundi_disaster
  examples: |
    - What was the Kadalundi train disaster?
    - Tell me about the Kadalundi train disaster
    - What happened in Kadalundi in 2001?
    - Can you explain the Kadalundi train accident?

- intent: ask_about_kadalundi_bridge
  examples: |
    - Can you tell me more about the Kadalundi bridge?
    - Where is the Kadalundi bridge located?
    - Tell me about the Kadalundi bridge
    - What are the coordinates of the Kadalundi bridge?

- intent: ask_about_kadalundi_geography
  examples: |
    - Where is the Kadalundi river?
    - What are the geographical details of the Kadalundi bridge?
    - Which districts does the Kadalundi bridge connect?
```
**Domain Configuration**

Create a file named `domain.yml` with the following content:
```
version: "3.0"

intents:
  - ask_about_kadalundi_disaster
  - ask_about_kadalundi_bridge
  - ask_about_kadalundi_geography

        The Kadalundi train disaster occurred in India on June 22, 2001, when the Mangalore-Chennai Mail passenger train was crossing over the Kadalundi river.
        During the incident, three carriages fell into the water, resulting in 59 people reported killed or missing, and up to 300 believed injured.
        The official inquiry attributed the derailment to one pillar of the 140-year-old bridge sinking into the riverbed due to recent heavy rain.
        However, subsequent private investigations have challenged this theory, suggesting other possible causes.

**Training the Model**

Run the following command to train the NLU model:
```
python -m rasa train nlu --data data/nlu.yml --config config/nlu_config.yml --output models/nlu
```
Run the following command to train the core model:
```
